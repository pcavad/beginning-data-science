# Collection of notebooks which I prepared along the specializations:

- Data Science professional with IBM
- Advanced Data Science with IBM
- Machine Learning with IBM
- AI Engineering with IBM

I also included a folder with links to visualizations (Google Data Studio and Tableau).

# Content:
- 1. Capstone project Adavanced Data Science with IBM specialization (image classification with a CNN).
- 2. Capstone project Data Science with IBM specialization (unsupervised classification).
- 3. Capstone project Machine Learning with IBM specialization (image classification with a CNN and optimizations).
- 4. Capstone project AI Engineering with IBM (image classification with pre-trained ResNet50 and VGG16).
- 5. Machine Learning projects (regression, classification, clustering).

Note: code style and conventions in the notebooks mirror a learning path.
