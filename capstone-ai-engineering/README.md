# Crack detection classifier

I built a crack detection classifier using a VGG16 pre-trained neural network and I compared the performace with a ResNet50 model which I trained in a previous lab.

# Content

1. Construct an ImageDataGenerator for training, validation and test.
2. Create a Sequential model using Keras and add a pre-trained VGG16 and a Dense layer.
3. Complie and fit the model.
4. Load a saved ResNet50 model.
5. Evaluate and compare the preformance.
6. Make predictions and show samples.

Data have been provided along the course of the project.
