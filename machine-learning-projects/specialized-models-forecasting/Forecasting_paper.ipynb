    "The business context is to support my customer with forecasting. Their business is seasonal with peak periods for Christmas time and events such as Black Friday. However, being a worldwide distribution different peak seasons may apply (e.g. Chinese New Year, etc). Being the brand less than 5 years the sale channels didn't start at the same time which adds a significant randomness to the data.\n",
