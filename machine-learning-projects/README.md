- exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis for the recipes of diffierent cuisines.
- supervised-learning-regression.ipynb: how to determine the price of a car.
- supervised-learning-classification.ipynb: how to determine the cuisine of a given recipe.
- unsupervised-learning.ipynb: use clustering to improve the classification project.
- specialized-models-forecasting: forecast timeseries for business transactions.
- clustering-neighborhoods-Toronto: unsupervised learning project (KMeans) - use https://nbviewer.org/ to see the images!
- image-classification-pytorch.ipynb: classify MNIST Fashion images with a PyTorch convolutional neural network.

I normally used data provided along each training program except for the specialized models where I re-used data from a customer and I made them anonymous for confidentialtiy reasons.
